# Tunnel_structure_image_data
## Hi there. ðŸ˜„
This is a pulic tunnel structure health image database including four object classes which are side trench damage (STD), non-side trench plate (NSTP), road crack (RC), leakage water (LW). Notably, another type of defect, vault lining spalling (VLS), is currently under experimental investigation and remains undisclosed. <br>
This project includes three types of images: raw images (see ./Images), high-exposure enhanced images (see ./Exposed Images, Î±=2.0), and on-car shooting tunnel images (see ./On-car shooting).

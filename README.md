## Hi there. ðŸ˜„
This is a pulic tunnel structure health image database including four object classes which are side trench damage (STD), non-side trench plate (NSTP), road crack (RC), leakage water (LW). Notably, another type of defect, vault lining spalling (VLS), is currently under experimental investigation and remains undisclosed.
